# Egg Chain Calculator

This is a tool for people who breed Pokémon which allows them to find the fastest route or routes from a specific Pokémon egg group to the desired one. It shows all the Pokémon from the start egg group, then shows which Pokémon to breed with through borders from left to right. Select one from the left most box, breed your Pokémon with it, then go to the next box if it exists and you'll eventually get to your desired egg group! 

This purpose of this was for when I was breeding Pokémon and wanted to have competitive bred Pokémon, however I did not have a Ditto to make this breeding easier. Therefore I was figuring out which Pokémon I had to breed in order to get to my desired Pokémon, however, this tool simplifies that significantly. This project is still in development so styling is expected to change.
